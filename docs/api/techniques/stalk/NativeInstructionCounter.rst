NativeInstructionCounter
========================

The ``NativeInstructionCounter``'s purpose is to allow you to more easily count
the number of instructions executed. Moreover, it also allows you to count
other things, such as the number of calls, returns, or blocks. This can be
useful when performing execution length analysis to find new paths.
